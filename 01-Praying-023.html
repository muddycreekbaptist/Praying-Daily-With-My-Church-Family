<div class="m">
<div class="c-drop">23</div> Father of truth and knowledge, we lift up in prayer our nation’s educational system. We recognize that the devil has led our educational system into humanism and ungodly beliefs and practices, even promoting an anti-Christ spirit and the practice of paganism. So, Father, we lift up to You those who work in this system—the administration, the teachers and aids, and all the other staff. Grant those working in the public and private educational system, including the home-schooling system, the Spirit of the Fear of the Lord, the Spirit of Wisdom, and the Spirit of Knowledge.</div>
<div class="p">Also look upon the parents and children who are in our educational system and give them a hunger to learn truth. Grant parents the courage to lead their children to the truth. Grant the parents the physical, mental, and emotional strength to encourage their children and help educate them in truth.</div>
<div class="p">Help our children to remember their Creator in the days of their youth, before the difficult days come, and the years draw near when they lose sight of the purpose of life. Save our youth, Lord. Save them from despair and from listening to the spirits of hate and suicide. Reveal Yourself to them, we cry. Though darkness is lying to keep them from truth, grant insight and understanding in the sciences, the arts, and the communication of truth and beauty in this world. No matter how much man and demons try, they cannot and will not bury truth. Glorify Christ in the schools and the homes. Amen. (Ecclesiastes 12:1; Proverbs 1:1-9; 2:1-5; 15:28)</div>
