<div class="m">
<div class="c-drop">17</div> God of Life, of spiritual life and physical life, we intercede for the safety of every child in the womb. This day we cry out for the unborn boys and girls. Each of these children are fearfully and wonderfully made for Your glory. Wrap Your protective arms around them. Please wake this nation up to stop murdering our children.</div>
<div class="p">We cry out for the mothers and fathers who have been deceived by the demonic spirit of death into this sin and re crushed. Father, You see the millions of women who are living under the bondage of shame and guilt from their sins. Open their hearts to know that forgiveness is found in Jesus. Lift them out of the prison of despair. Bring healing to their souls and to their bodies. And Lord, forgive them, we ask. We know what it is like to be deceived and to walk in darkness. You forgave us and healed us. We ask for mercy and new life in them.</div>
<div class="p">We also pray for those who are carrying out the work of Satan in the abortion clinics. Oâ€™ Father, they are blind and do not know what they are doing. Open their hearts to the truth and deliver them from the kingdom of darkness. Turn them from workers of death to workers of life and righteousness; from slaves of sin to proclaimers and defenders of the unborn. You are more than able to do this. No heart is beyond Your saving arm. And turn the leaders of this nation to see the sanctity and beauty of every life, and give them the courage and wisdom to stand and protect the unborn. Amen. (Psalm 139:14-18; Exodus 21:22-25; 23:7; Proverbs 6:16-17; 24:11-12; Jeremiah 22:17)</div>
