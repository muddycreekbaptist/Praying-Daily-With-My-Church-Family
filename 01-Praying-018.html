<div class="s"><div id="s1">Day 18</div></div>
<div class="d"><div id="d1">For the ministry gifts in the local church</div></div>
<div class="m">
<div class="c-drop">18</div> Father, our petition this day is for the ministry gifts that You have put in Your local churches. Thank You for these ministry gifts. Grant Your saints to recognize Your gifts of ministry and to use them in faith, in love, with humility, and in the power of Your Spirit for Thy glory.</div>
<div class="p">Forgive us for when we have used these gifts and abilities to draw attention to ourselves for our own glory. Forgive us of such shameful self-centeredness. We are who we are by the grace of God. We are Your workmanship, through and through. You have created and formed us, and called us by name.</div>
<div class="p">Equip us for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ, so that we all come to the unity of the faith and knowledge of the Son of God, to a mature man, to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ; that we should no longer be children, tossed around in various unbiblical beliefs and carried about with every wind of teaching, by the trickery of men, in the cunning craftiness by which they lie in wait to deceive, but speaking the truth in love, may we grow up in all things into Him who is the head-that is Christ, from whom the whole body, joined and knitted together by what every member supplies. Effectively raise up each member within each local church to fulfill their share, so that we, by Thy Spirit may cause growth of the body for the edifying of itself in love. Amen! (Ephesians 2:4-10; 4:12-16; Isaiah 63:1-2)</div>
