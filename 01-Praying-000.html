<div class="ip">The daily prayers in this book are intended to be only a supplement to your daily prayer time with our heavenly Father. Written prayers help to unify, but they cannot replace the individual, sincere bearing of the soul before God. These prayers may help guide, but they should not be the whole embodiment of your soul’s cry and its expression of gratitude and worship. </div>
<div class="ip">While you are praying through these daily prayers, listen and follow your heart to enlarge the prayer. Do not be bound to the words in a written prayer, but let them be a spring board. Pursue further, deeper, and more personal in the subject of the daily prayer. Expect the Holy Spirit to lead you. Let your heart go. Do not restrain it. Let it fly on the breath of the One who is praying with you and in you.</div>
<div class="ip">As a community of believers, we join together in faith and bring unified requests and praises to our God, who hears and answers prayer. Indeed, we believe and know, therefore we pray. As it is written,</div>
<div class="iq1 top-spacing">Psalm 34:15 (ESV) — The eyes of the LORD are toward the righteous and his ears toward their cry.</div>
<div class="ip">Whether your prayer time is in the morning, during the day, or at night, our prayers will unite. This is the work of the Holy Spirit, who is everywhere present and within the souls of all the saints. By Him we pray and with His help in prayer we are built up in our faith. For it is written,</div>
<div class="iq1 top-spacing">Jude 20 (ESV) — But you, beloved, building yourselves up in your most holy faith and praying in the Holy Spirit, …</div>
<div class="ip">What is the end purpose of this uniting in prayer? That the kingdom of God will come and His will be done, on earth as it is heaven; in the power of the Spirit, through the mediation of the Savior, to the glory of the Father. Amen.</div>
<div class="is"><div id="is2">Scriptures of Encouragement</div></div>
<div class="im">Psalm 5:1–3 — Give ear to my words, O LORD; consider my groaning. 2 Give attention to the sound of my cry, my King and my God, for to you do I pray. 3 O LORD, in the morning you hear my voice; in the morning I prepare a sacrifice for you and watch.</div>
<div class="im">Psalm 34:15, 17 — The eyes of the LORD are toward the righteous and his ears toward their cry. 17 When the righteous cry for help, the LORD hears and delivers them out of all their troubles.</div>
<div class="im">Psalm 65:2–4 — O you who hear prayer, to you shall all flesh come. 3 When iniquities prevail against me, you atone for our transgressions. 4 Blessed is the one you choose and bring near, to dwell in your courts! We shall be satisfied with the goodness of your house, the holiness of your temple!</div>
<div class="im">Psalm 66:19 — But truly God has listened; he has attended to the voice of my prayer.</div>
<div class="im">Psalm 88:13 — But I, O LORD, cry to you; in the morning my prayer comes before you.</div>
<div class="im">Psalm 116:1–2 — I love the LORD, because he has heard my voice and my pleas for mercy. 2 Because he inclined his ear to me, therefore I will call on him as long as I live.</div>
<div class="im">Psalm 145:18–20 — The LORD is near to all who call on him, to all who call on him in truth. 19 He fulfills the desire of those who fear him; he also hears their cry and saves them. 20 The LORD preserves all who love him, but all the wicked he will destroy.</div>
<div class="im">Matthew 6:5–6 — “And when you pray, you must not be like the hypocrites. For they love to stand and pray in the synagogues and at the street corners, that they may be seen by others. Truly, I say to you, they have received their reward. 6 But when you pray, go into your room and shut the door and pray to your Father who is in secret. And your Father who sees in secret will reward you.”</div>
<div class="im">Matthew 7:7–11 — “Ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be opened to you. 8 For everyone who asks receives, and the one who seeks finds, and to the one who knocks it will be opened. 9 Or which one of you, if his son asks him for bread, will give him a stone? 10 Or if he asks for a fish, will give him a serpent? 11 If you then, who are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father who is in heaven give good things to those who ask him!”</div>
<div class="im">Romans 12:12 — Rejoice in hope, be patient in tribulation, be constant in prayer.</div>
<div class="im">Ephesians 6:18 — praying at all times in the Spirit, with all prayer and supplication. To that end, keep alert with all perseverance, making supplication for all the saints,</div>
<div class="im">Philippians 1:3–5 — I thank my God in all my remembrance of you, 4 always in every prayer of mine for you all making my prayer with joy, 5 because of your partnership in the gospel from the first day until now.</div>
<div class="im">Philippians 4:6 — do not be anxious about anything, but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known to God.</div>
<div class="im">Colossians 4:2–4 — Continue steadfastly in prayer, being watchful in it with thanksgiving. 3 At the same time, pray also for us, that God may open to us a door for the word, to declare the mystery of Christ, on account of which I am in prison— 4 that I may make it clear, which is how I ought to speak.</div>
<div class="im">1 Thessalonians 5:17 — pray without ceasing,</div>
<div class="im">Hebrews 4:16 — Let us then with confidence draw near to the throne of grace, that we may receive mercy and find grace to help in time of need.</div>
<div class="im">James 5:16 — The prayer of a righteous person has great power as it is working.</div>
