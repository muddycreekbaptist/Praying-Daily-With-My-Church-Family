<div class="m">
<div class="c-drop">7</div> Jesus, Head of the Church, and Keeper of Your flock, beautiful and glorious is Your Bride. You have sanctified Your saints in Your redeeming blood. We are clothed in robes of white—righteousness not of this world, but of Your divine righteousness. For all eternity we will offer praise and thanksgiving for whom You have made us.</div>
<div class="p">Father, strengthen with courage those whom You have ordained to lead and guide Your Churches. Grant them wisdom and discernment. Grant them clarity in the Scriptures and the message of the Cross. Grant them boldness to speak as they ought the message of truth. Grant them favor with their congregations and in their communities. Prune them to bear more fruit. Grant them a repentant and contrite heart that they may walk and serve humbly before You and man. May any self-serving character that is buried within be uprooted and thrown into the fire. Turn our church leaders from the love of earthly gain to seek only the approval and glory of their Savior.</div>
<div class="p">Daily fill Your spiritual leaders afresh with the Holy Spirit in power to be witnesses of Jesus. Make them to be leaders who represent the Savior and never themselves. Give them a deep conviction—a heart changing conviction, to be God-pleasers and not man-pleasers. Protect these leaders from the plots and schemes of the evil one. Constantly remind them of their high calling. And Father, lead them to the place of prayer where they grow in communion with You. Amen. (Ephesians 5:12; Hebrews 10:10; 13:17-18; 2 Thessalonians 3:1-5; Galatians 1:10)</div>
