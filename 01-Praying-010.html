<div class="m">
<div class="c-drop">10</div> O’ God, the Righteous and Just One, Who sees and judges the hearts of all men according to Your law, forgive us I pray. As a nation we have turned our back on You. We have shaken our fist at You, abandoned You, and cursed and blasphemed Your holy name. There is no longer shame for the abominations in our hearts and on our hands. We have even become proud of our rebelliousness and sins. We love darkness rather than light, and falsehood over truth. We exalt and worship the god of power, of riches, of popularity, and perhaps the highest altar we worship at is self-love. We are wretched and guilty.</div>
<div class="p">But God, we do not know what we are doing. The hearts of this nation are blinded. The enemy has put a veil over our understanding so that we cannot see right from wrong. Forgive us, O’ God, and have mercy on us.</div>
<div class="p">I do not deny that we deserve the consequences of our sins. Yes, we deserve the wrath that rained down upon Sodom and Gomorrah and the wrath that we’ve stored up against ourselves. But Lord, we petition Your longsuffering and patience. We petition Your mercy and forgiveness. Turn our hearts from idolatry to the living Savior, that our nation would humble itself and repent like Nineveh at the preaching of Jonah.</div>
<div class="p">Lord, if Your judgement has come and You will not turn it back, then strengthen Your Church in this nation. And come, Lord Jesus, Come. Come quickly. Amen. (Ezekiel 14:6; Jonah 2:8; II Chronicles 6:21; Revelation 22:20)</div>
