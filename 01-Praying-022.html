<div class="d"><div id="d1">That the world may know He alone is God</div></div>
<div class="m">
<div class="c-drop">22</div> God of Muddy Creek Baptist body of believers, grant us a contrite spirit. A heart that loathes all sin, even the appearance of sin, and all worldliness. Grant, I ask, a humble spirit that seeks to live and walk in holiness--in a manner that rightly reflects whom You have made us in Christ.</div>
<div class="p">May people around us, whether in our own homes as family members, our neighbors, our co-workers, our friends, and strangers see YOU in us and KNOW that You are the LORD, and there is no other. Cause Your Name to be hallowed before the world through and by Your living Church around the world.</div>
<div class="p">Because of the Holy Spirit who abides with us, within us, and upon us, cause it to be clearly known that YOU ARE OUR GOD, and we are Your beloved people.</div>
<div class="p">Make those around us who walk in darkness yearn for the love and light that they see upon us. Enable them to see Jesus Christ as the Light of the World and the Bread of Life; as the Resurrection and the Life. Enable those who are weary and heavy laden by trying to earn their way to You to see Jesus, clearly and humbly, as the One who is the Way, the Truth, and the Life. Lift up The Son high so that those whom You have called will see Him and run to Him, falling down before Him, and surrendering to Him. Oh, the glory of such a sight. The angels of heaven to shout and rejoice in celebration at every sinner who calls upon Jesus.</div>
<div class="p">All of this that Your Name would be honored in this land. Amen. (Ezekiel 36; I Kings 18:36-37; Isaiah 43:1; 45:5-7)</div>
