<div class="d"><div id="d1">For Muddy Creek Baptist Church</div></div>
<div class="m">
<div class="c-drop">2</div> God of Prayer, Lord and Head of the Church, our prayer is for the body of believers of Muddy Creek Baptist church. Yet, Father, as we pray for Muddy Creek Church, please accept this prayer for all of Your churches in this area, in our state, in our county, and around the world.</div>
<div class="p">This is Your church, Your body of believers. It is not mine or anyone else’s, but Yours Alone! You have Redeemed us and called us together to form a ministry of reconciliation.</div>
<div class="p">The uniqueness of this local body is comprised as it is so that we would fit together to fulfill the unique purpose that You designed in Your providential will. Unite us in one spirit, one faith, and in the direction that You have determined. Unite all whom You have called to make up this local body—this church. And reveal to us Your Will and Your Purpose for this unique community of believers.</div>
<div class="p">Weave our hearts together to beat as one, and our one unified heart to beat in unison with Your heart. Give us the desire of Your heart for this church. Then those who are outside Your kingdom may see Your heart through us. Holy Spirit, continue to stoke a fire of compassion for the harvest fields--local and global. Make us restless unless we are laboring in preparation or laboring in these fields. Magnify the call of the church in us and make it plain before us.</div>
<div class="p">To the end that Jesus, the Christ, is glorified throughout eternity from the fruit of Muddy Creek! Amen. (I Corinthians 5:18-02; Ephesians 4:1-16)</div>
