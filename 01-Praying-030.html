<div class="c-drop">30</div> God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of Glory, may You give us the Spirit of Wisdom and Revelation in the knowledge of You--the eyes of our understanding being enlightened, that we may KNOW what is the hope of Your calling; what are the riches of the glory of Your inheritance in the saints; and what is the exceeding greatness of Your power in them who believe--according to the working of Your mighty power which You worked in Christ when You raised Him from the dead and seated Him at Your right hand in the heavenly places, far above all rule and authority and power and every name that is named, not only in this age, but also in that which is to come. For You have put all things under Christâ€™s feet and gave Him as head over all things to the church, which is His body, the fullness of Him who fills all in all. Blessing and Honor forever unto the name of Jesus Christ, our God and Savior. Amen. (Ephesians 1:15-23)</div>
