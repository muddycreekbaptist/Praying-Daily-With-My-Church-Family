<div class="c-drop">27</div> We look upon Jesus, the Head of the Church. We are members of the Church by Your choosing, and not of our own doing or of our own righteousness and goodness.</div>
<div class="p">Today we lift up in prayer Your local churches around us. Those whom You have built; those whom exalt Jesus Christ has King and Savior; where the Gospel is preached; where Thy Spirit abides. Strengthen in grace the leaders of these churches. Lead the congregations in Your ways to carry out the mission that You have appointed to each of them. Open their hearts to hear and discern truth. Enable them to live godly lives and bear much fruit to Your glory, and the exaltation of Your Name in their communities.</div>
<div class="p">Within each church body, unite them in the one true faith. Unite them in the spirit of peace and unity. Weed out division; expose the wolves who seek to destroy and devour Your sheep; and breath a fresh wind of Pentecost in each local church.</div>
<div class="p">And Father, whether it be through tribulation or revival, unite all of us in fellowship and purpose that Your kingdom would manifest showing the world the redeeming power and love of Jesus. Amen. (John 1:12-13; Romans 8:29-10; Ephesians 4:1-6; 5:27; I Corinthians 12:12-13)</div>
