<div class="d"><div id="d1">For spiritual hunger and zeal in our land</div></div>
<div class="m">
<div class="c-drop">24</div> Our hearts earnestly seek after You. Our souls thirst for you, our flesh longs for you, as in a dry and weary land where there is no water. We have looked upon You and we have beheld Your power and glory. Because Your steadfast love is better than life, our lips will praise You. And we will bless You as long as we live; in Your name we will lift up our hands. You, Oâ€™ God have been our help, and in the shadow of Your wings we will sing for joy. Our souls cling to You; Your right hand upholds us. And those who seek to destroy Your Church shall go down into the depths of the earth.</div>
<div class="p">Our Father, do not let the zeal of your Church fade, but rather increase the flame that burns within, causing it to burn even hotter. Let us be consumed with zeal in our worship and service. You are worthy of all that we can offer and much, much more.</div>
<div class="p">Jesus, we want Your words and commandments to be alive within us. We want Your resurrection life that is in us to quicken our hearts to follow hard after You. Help us to see You everywhere we turn and in everything we do. Help us see how the cross has affected every living thing, and how Your resurrection continues to give new life to others. By the influencing power of Your Spirit, let our love for You and for the Gospel pound in our hearts so that we cannot keep You to ourselves. Blessed be Your name forevermore. Amen. (Psalm 63; 119:139)</div>
