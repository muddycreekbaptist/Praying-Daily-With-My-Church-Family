<div class="d"><div id="d1">Peace and Faith in this World’s Crisis</div></div>
<div class="m">
<div class="c-drop">26</div> Our nation has abandoned You. We have closed our ears to Your voice and instructions. Where is the fear of the Lord? The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom. Where is faith in the God who formed this nation to proclaim Your name--who gave us liberty, justice, and equality among one another? Where is repentance? Without faith and repentance there is no humility and hearts will not look up for Your help. We have turned to ourselves. Forgive us.</div>
<div class="p">Here we are, wealthy in materialism but naked in righteousness before You and impoverished in virtues and character of the heart. As You see, our land is held in bondage to fear and hate. Because our hearts are turned away from You, we have become enslaved in fear—fear of disease; fear of one another; fear of tomorrow; even fear of ourselves. This fear has driven us to withdraw from one another and hide. There is also little faith among Your people to trust in Your sovereign rule, including over diseases and wickedness. The lies and propaganda of demons amplify the fears and divide this nation, turning us against each other. We are to blame for our misery and enslavement. Our idols became snares and our disobedience has led us into this bondage.</div>
<div class="p">God of Mercy and Longsuffering turn our anxiety to peace. Deliver us from fear and into faith. Cause these fears to humble us to look up and cry out to You, rather than looking within ourselves. You are the only answer for us. Amen. (Judges 2:11-17; Hebrews 11:6; Revelation 3:17-22)</div>
