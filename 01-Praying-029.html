<div class="m">
<div class="c-drop">29</div> This day, along with my brothers and sisters in Christ, I intercede for the families that are broken by sin and the deceptions of the evil one. Bring healing and reconciliation to families. Heal our nation’s families, we cry. Turn the hearts of families to realize that You are the answer, and that it is You alone who can heal and save. Raise up family ministries in Your churches. Strengthen the para-church ministries that minster to families.</div>
<div class="p">You alone, O’ Lord, know the brokenness and the true cause of the brokenness. Man doesn’t know the heart, only the Spirit of God knows and discerns what truly lies within the depths of a man’s heart. We ask that somehow, some way, that You would bring healing and reconciliation to the homes of our communities and of this nation.</div>
<div class="p">We also interceded on behalf of the spouses and children and parents who are being abused and neglected. Rescue them, Jesus. Heal them from their wounds, trauma, and scars. And fill them with Your everlasting love.</div>
<div class="p">Show us, Muddy Creek Baptist Church, as You show me personally, what we can do to minister to broken and hurting families. Here I am, Lord; here we are, Lord, use us. Amen. (I Peter 3:7; 4:8; Exodus 20:12; Psalm 127:3-5; 147:3; Joshua 24:15; Proverbs 11:29; Colossians 3:18-21)</div>
