<div class="d"><div id="d1">Repentance for our self-righteousness</div></div>
<div class="m">
<div class="c-drop">12</div> Our Father, Who lifts up the humble and lays low the proud, forgive us of the pride and self-righteousness that abide in our hearts. Our hearts belong to You, and not to ourselves, nor to this godless world we sojourn in each day. Shamefully we put confidence in our own goodness and good deeds. We puff ourselves up as good people who have earned Your blessings and love. This self-righteousness is deplorable and denies Thy grace. Help us to remember that anything good in us is solely because of Your goodness and love that is in us by the Holy Spirit. It is because of Your love, Your life, and Your light, that there is any goodness within us at all. As it is written, we can do nothing apart from Christ Jesus—Who is the vine, and we are the branches. All life and goodness comes from Him who is in us and not from ourselves.</div>
<div class="p">Grant us, Your people, a spirit of humility. By Thy Spirit cultivate a daily repentance from the self-love that leads us to think too highly of ourselves as we ought. This is a daily battle that we cannot win in our own strength. But You can help us to turn our eyes upon Jesus. O’ Jesus, the One we adore, help us fix our eyes upon You rather than ourselves. Glorify Yourself in us, O’ Jesus, Lover of our Souls. Amen. (James 4:10; I Peter 5:5; Romans 8:7; John 15:1-5; Hebrews 12:1-2)</div>
