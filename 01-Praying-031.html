<div class="m">
<div class="c-drop">31</div> Father, our Heavenly Father, full of mercy, full of goodness, whose ear is towards the prayers of Your people who are in Christ, I lift up my heart to You this hour. I know You hear our cries and see our tears for our spouses, children, grandchildren, and brothers and sisters. Our cries and tears are that each of them would be delivered out of the kingdom of darkness and be born again in Christ by the Spirit of Life. And those who have fallen asleep in their faith, awakened their souls by the Spirit of Life so that they will join the chorus of praise with the rest of the saints.</div>
<div class="p">As the Jailer and his family were saved and filled with Your Spirit; as Cornelius and his whole household heard the Gospel and were filled with the Spirit, so fill our spouses, children, and grandchildren. Cause the seeds of the gospel that are in them to grow and bear fruit that glorifies Christ Jesus. And for those who have not heard the saving Gospel, cause them to hear, understand, repent, and be born again. Yes, we plead for their deliverance. Remove the veil over their understanding, and shine into their hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.</div>
<div class="p">You hold their hearts. No one can resist the Spirit of God. What You purpose to do, will be. Reveal Your Arm of Salvation, O' God. Usher them into the light, to the Glory of Christ. Amen. (Psalm 34:15; Acts 11:13-15; 16:29-34; Romans 9:19; 2 Corinthians 4:3-6)</div>
