<div class="d"><div id="d1">Praise and exaltation to the Lord our God</div></div>
<div class="m">
<div class="c-drop">14</div> You, our Lord, are worthy of the highest of praises. You are clothed in perfect light. Truth is as a belt upon Your waist. You are Just in all Your ways, and the only perfect love that exists is from You. One day You will receive the honor and praise that You deserve.</div>
<div class="p">By Thy Spirit, give Your saints a voice of Praise. One voice that drowns out the sounds of this world and rises into the heavens. A song of praise that makes creation jealous to join us. A song of Adoration that echoes through the forests, across the prairies, upon the mountains, and in the halls, homes, and offices of every town and city.</div>
<div class="p">Let all who fear Your name join together in worship. Let the testimonies of the redeemed ring out one and then another, and then another, until the whole world knows of Your greatness and glory. Fill us with such bold praise to prepare for Your return. Then on that day, that wonderful day of victory, creation will rejoice with us for it has eagerly longed for the revealing of the sons of God, for then it will be set free from its bondage. Erupt, erupt oh springs of living water within our souls. Let us sing a new song unto the King of Glory. For He is worthy! Amen (Psalm 65:1; Romans 8:19-23; Psalm 40:3; Revelation 5:9)</div>
