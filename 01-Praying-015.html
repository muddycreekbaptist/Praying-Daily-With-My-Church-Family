<div class="s"><div id="s1">Day 15</div></div>
<div class="d"><div id="d1">The translation and distribution of Scripture</div></div>
<div class="m">
<div class="c-drop">15</div> Our Father, God of Truth, God of Knowledge and Understanding, hear our prayers and be pleased. We know personally the powerful impact of reading and meditating on Scripture. We have such a privilege of having the Bible in our language and at our disposal. Forgive us for thinking too light of this privilege, taking it for granted.</div>
<div class="p">Our prayer this day is for the Scripture to be translated and published into all of the languages across the world. And where it has been translated into the heart-language of the people, open up distribution avenues for Bibles to spread across their lands; across social, cultural, geographical, and economic boundaries. We ask that the Holy Spirit open the understanding of all who obtain a copy of the scriptures. May the Gospel of Grace and Salvation shout from the scriptures. May hearts be set free and healing flow into lives, families, communities, and nations. Yes, even shaking the foundation of the nations.</div>
<div class="p">Those whom You have called to translate and deliver the Scripture throughout spiritually dry lands, grant clarity of the truth of Your Word. Grant them the means needed to labor in such a high calling.</div>
<div class="p">Through the spread of the Scripture across this earth may the truth be revealed that Jesus Christ is the Way, the Truth, and the Life, and forgiveness and eternal life are found in Him, and in Him alone, to all who call upon His Name. Amen. (Proverbs 1:20-21; III John 1:8; Matthew 9:38)</div>
