<div class="c-drop">1</div> Thank You, O' God of the Redeemed, for the grace which You have given and continue to give us in Christ Jesus.</div>
<div class="p">I thank You for this grace which has enriched us in everything by Him in all utterance and all knowledge, even as the testimony of Christ was confirmed among us, so that we come short in no gift, eagerly waiting for the revelation of our Lord Jesus Christ.</div>
<div class="p">Our God, You are faithful in Your calling of us—individually and our callings as a body of believers, into the fellowship of the Son, Jesus Christ our LORD.</div>
<div class="p">My heart is not deep enough to contain all of the praises that our Savior, Jesus Christ, deserves from my lips. I was once lost, separated from You and Your divine grace, enslaved to my sin and under condemnation. But Jesus sought me out and as the Good Shepherd rescued me and forgave me. Then the Holy Spirit gave me a new heart that is clean and full of love. It is a heart that loves You and desires truth. Praises and more praises to You, our Father.</div>
<div class="p">Blessed Jesus, if it were not for You, I don’t know how far into the bondage of my sin I would be today. And here I am this day, walking with You and able to love You with a free and forgiven heart. Help me and all the saints have a growing zeal for You and for Your gift of eternal life. You are God with us, and because of You, we are with God whom we can call “Abba Father.” Truly, You--Jesus, are our joy! Amen! (I Corinthians 1:4-9)</div>
