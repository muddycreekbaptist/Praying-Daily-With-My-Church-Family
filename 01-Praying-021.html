<div class="m">
<div class="c-drop">21</div> Father, we collectively intercede today for those whom You have called and commissioned to take the Gospel of Jesus Christ to the frontlines of the mission field. We stand with them and support them as one with us. Prove the Gospel they proclaim and live with signs, wonders, and miracles. Prove that Jesus is the one and only reconciler between sinful man and God. Set free the oppressed, heal the lame, give sight to the blind, hearing to the deaf, peace to the fearful and hopeless, and display Your mighty power to crush the works of evil in their midst. Let it be known that You are God and there is no other! Let it be unmistakable that there is salvation in no other name!</div>
<div class="p">Grant Your servants this day their daily bread. You know what they and their families need. Provide for what will unfold this day. You give sufficient grace. Help them see it and walk in it.</div>
<div class="p">Strengthen them in their trials, in their tests, and in their temptations. We know that the evil one plots against them to destroy them. Protect those whom You have stationed in communities, villages, and nations that are hostile to the Gospel and to Your messengers, and grant them courage, boldness, and wisdom. Grant them heavenly peace and with it a growing love for the lost around them, including for their persecutors.</div>
<div class="p">We know those You call, You equip. We also know that Your love and care for them is eternally beyond ours. They are safe in Your care and calling. Blessed be Your name forever more. Amen. (Acts 3:16; 9-12; 4:23-31; 5:12-16; Matthew 6:9-13)</div>
