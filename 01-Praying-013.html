<div class="c-drop">13</div> Our hearts cry rivers of tears for the children who are victims of human trafficking. How long, O’ Lord? How long will this terror continue? How long will the wicked steal the souls and bodies of our children? Act, O’ Father. In Your name bring justice for them. Crush the evil works and bring liberty to the enslaved.</div>
<div class="p">Grant the organizations that You have raised up to fight this devilish work to have favor with governing authorities. Use them as tools of righteousness and justice. Lead them where to go to bring release to the captives. Yes, Lord, it is time to act. From Your compassion, rescue these prisoners of man’s lust and greed. Rescue them; rescue them.</div>
<div class="p">Also, Father, we ask that healing be poured into these broken and ravished lives. You are able to heal and mend together what evil has torn apart. In the name of Jesus, let healing flow into every fiber of their being. Strengthen and provide for those who are weeping with these children. Fill their homes with heavenly peace and with joy unspeakable and full of glory.</div>
<div class="p">Jesus, be their King! Conquer their captors, and lead them out of bondage. Heal their brokenness. Fill them with Your love. Cleanse them from their shames, fears, and evil memories. Hide them in Your everlasting arms. Raise Your victory banner high over them. Amen. (Psalm 10; Isaiah 61:1-3)</div>
