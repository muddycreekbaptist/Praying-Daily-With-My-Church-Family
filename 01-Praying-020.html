<div class="m">
<div class="c-drop">20</div> God of Heaven and Earth, Creator of Life, Maker of the stars, and the myriad of solar systems that are Your servants. I lift my heart with my brothers and sisters of faith because You have revealed Yourself to us. We are humbled beyond words that the infinite God would take thought of us, and yet You love us and call us to come and know You.</div>
<div class="p">You have revealed Yourself as The Lord our Shepherd; The Lord our Provider; The Lord our Peace, The Lord our Protector and Deliverer; and The Ever-Present One. We will dwell in the shelter of the Most High, for You are our Shield and Shade, our High Tower and Strong Tower, our Hiding Place and Place of Refuge.</div>
<div class="p">Jesus, Son of God, Son of Man, the Word of God manifest in human form. You are our Advocate and Mediator before God; our Eternal Sacrifice and High Priest before the heavenly altar. You are The Good Shepherd; The Faithful One; The Lord of Lords and King of Kings; The Alpha and Omega—the First and the Last—The Beginning and The End; The Prince of Peace; The Faithful Witness, the Firstborn of the Dead, and the Ruler of kings on earth. You are the Resurrection and The Life; the very Bread of Life and our Hope of Glory. You are the root and descendant of David, the Bright Morning Star. You are the Lamb of God who died and rose again, coming again as King and Conqueror who will judge the nations in righteousness. And Jesus, we are Yours as You are ours-our God and Savior. And we say, “Come Lord Jesus, Come.” Amen. (Psalm 91:1-2; 119:89-91; 144:3; John 1:1-18; I Timothy 2:5; Acts 17:30-31; Revelation 22)</div>
