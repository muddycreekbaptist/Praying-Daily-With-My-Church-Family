<div class="m">
<div class="c-drop">9</div> Bless the Holy and Mighty name of the Lord, our God! You are the God who hears and answers prayer. Make us—Your Church, a House of Prayer! That is, a living Church who seeks You in prayer; who petitions You in and through prayer; who worships You in prayer. Stir us to fall on our knees and pray and give us a taste of Thy glorious presence. Teach us, lead us, and empower us to pray according to Your good pleasure and will.</div>
<div class="p">God of Answered Prayer, show the world the power of Your kingdom through the prayers of the saints. Show the world Your heart, majesty, might, and goodness through answering the prayers of those who call upon Your name.</div>
<div class="p">Grant us passion in our prayers that we may believe and persevere in prayer. Unite our hearts in the spirit of prayer. Invade our hearts with a passion to pray that burns with such fervency that we will set aside earthly and futile interests to seek Your face. A fervency that responses to our calling above our comforts. And as we abide with You in prayer—in corporate prayer and private prayer, shake the foundations of this world. Bring showers of mercy and righteousness to the weak, the poor, the broken, and the captive. And in doing all of this, the Gospel message of Jesus Christ will be affirmed and manifest in this broken and unjust world. Prove Yourself as the God of Prayer!</div>
<div class="p">Lord, when You return on The Day, may you find Your Church in prayer and in the harvest fields. Amen! (Psalm 116:1-2; Isaiah 56:7; Matthew 21:13; Ephesians 6:18; Mark 13:32-37)</div>
