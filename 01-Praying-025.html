<div class="d"><div id="d1">For those who serve to protect us</div></div>
<div class="m">
<div class="c-drop">25</div> Father, we pray for the men and women who serve our communities and our nation--whose responsibility is to protect us and help us live in this freedom that You have granted us, so that we may live a peaceable and godly life; that injustice and wickedness will be held accountable and that righteousness will prevail on this earth.</div>
<div class="p">You have called men and women to serve Your purposes of righteousness and justice. Give them the Spirit of the Fear of the Lord, and enable them to recognize the deceptive intentions of the wicked, as well as the good works of the righteous. Strengthen them to carry out justice, to rescue the victims of evil, and give them victory over lawlessness. In their duties, protect them from the wicked. May the hosts of heaven accompany them to guard them in all their ways, and bear them up lest they strike their foot against a stone. Though the enemy encamp around them, give them courage, yet also compassion. We know that seeing and dealing with the darkness of sin day-in and day-out can make it difficult to see Your glory and Your goodness. Bring a fresh light of hope to the hearts of these servants.</div>
<div class="p">We also pray for their families--their marriages, their children, and for all of their loved ones. Grant them grace in times of need. And Savior, we ask that you show these servants the redeeming Gospel of Jesus. May they see Your hand with them and their need for eternal life through and in You. This we also ask for their families. Amen. (Romans 13:1-5; Psalm 91:11-12; I Timothy 2:1-2; Psalm 147:6)</div>
