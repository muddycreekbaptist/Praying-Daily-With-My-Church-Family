<div class="c-drop">19</div> Father, hear our cries for this nation’s youth. You see their captivity in the darkness. Come, O’ God, the Conqueror, Deliverer, the Mighty One who saves. Raise up harvest workers to communicate the Gospel to them, which is the power of God to save. Yes, O’ Lord, make Your truth come alive to their hearts by Your Spirit. Set them free! Cast off the veil that the god of the world has put over their eyes. Then they will see with unveiled hearts and they too will behold the glory of the Lord and be transformed into the same image from one degree of glory to another by the Spirit of the Lord.</div>
<div class="p">We believe that You are preparing an army within Your kingdom made up of our young people. They will be filled with courage and zeal. You will equip them and empower them with the Holy Spirit to storm the gates of hell and in the name of the Savior they will slay the enemy and rescue the captives. We believe that the army of heaven will accompany them to raise the banner of truth within the darkest pits of Satan’s activities. Where darkness and godlessness are thriving, the name of the Lord will be heard with shouts of victory. The light of truth will prevail in His name! Raise them up, O’ King. Now is the time. Reveal the power of the Throne of Heaven. (Romans 1:16; II Corinthians 3:13-17)</div>
