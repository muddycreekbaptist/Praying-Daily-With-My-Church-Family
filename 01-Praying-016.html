<div class="d"><div id="d1">laborers for Your harvest fields</div></div>
<div class="m">
<div class="c-drop">16</div> Lord of the Harvest, You have prepared a harvest, ripe and ready for laborers. Raise up laborers. Prepare and train and fill them, and grant them the power to be witnesses. Our petition today is that You would continue to make the body of Muddy Creek Baptist Church to be laborers. Continue to grant us an inward compassion that drives us to want to share the light with those in darkness. Grant to those whom we take the light of truth, to hear with their hearts and believe. Grant them the gifts of repentance and saving grace.</div>
<div class="p">We recognize the very mission field that You have placed us here to reach with the Gospel. Therefore, we ask that You would continue to prepare us to sow, reap, and disciple the harvest, and also prepare the harvest of souls for Your Kingdom and glory. And we do not pray only for Muddy Creek Baptist Church, but churches throughout the land. Shine Your face upon us that the peoples of this land would hear and know the Gospel of Jesus Christ; that all who live in Powhatan and the surrounding counties may see Your Right Arm of Salvation; that Your Name would be feared and extolled among the peoples.</div>
<div class="p">As Your Gospel has changed us, cause it to change these souls around us. All of this to Your Glory, in this life and forever, AMEN! (Matthew 28:19-20; 9:37-38; Acts 1:8; Psalm 67:1-2; 119:135; Daniel 9:17)</div>
