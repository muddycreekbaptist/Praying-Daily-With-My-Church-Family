<div class="c-drop">3</div> The Lord of Hosts is Your Name. Mighty is Your Name to Save. Blessed be Your Name forever more!</div>
<div class="p">I know that You hear the cries of the persecuted. Blessed are those who are persecuted for Your Nameâ€™s sake. Their sorrows, pain, nakedness, their unjust treatment, and as with Abel their blood cries out to You from the ground. In their sufferings strengthen them. Cause the faith within them to rise up and stand strong in the strength of Your might.</div>
<div class="p">In their pain, may Your grace bring the ointment of healing.</div>
<div class="p">In their hunger and thirst, nourishment and drink.</div>
<div class="p">In their imprisonment, joy and endurance.</div>
<div class="p">In their outcast, a covering of belonging and love.</div>
<div class="p">In the face of their tormentors, wisdom and courage.</div>
<div class="p">In their fear, let them taste heaven.</div>
<div class="p">Father, we will not let our brothers and sisters suffer alone. As one member suffers, we suffer with them. Grant the saints everywhere, including Muddy Creek, a burden to lift up and rally around our persecuted family members of the faith. According to Your will, cause their suffering to result in an everlasting testimony of Your faithfulness. Amen. (Hebrews 13:3; Matthew 5:11-12; 25:34-40)</div>
