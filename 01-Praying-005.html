<div class="d"><div id="d1">Our nation, its leaders, and civil servants</div></div>
<div class="m">
<div class="c-drop">5</div> Father, we lift up our nation and those in positions of authority. Our prayer is for our President and all whom You have ordained in the place of governing authority. Those on the national, state, and local levels. May the Spirit of the Lord be upon them. Give them true wisdom. Protect them from deception and foolish counselors, and guide them that we may lead a peaceful and quiet life, godly and dignified in every way.</div>
<div class="p">We ask for Your hand of protection and guidance on all those who serve to protect us, lead us, and stand for justice. For those who defend and fight for the weak and frail. For those who daily place their lives in harm’s way for us. As it is written, these men and women are Your servants for good. Cause Your favor to shine upon them.</div>
<div class="p">Father, we know that Jesus is the answer for this nation, as with the whole world. It doesn’t need more politics or more money, power, or fame. It needs Jesus. Bring an awakening to our nation, like that of the Great Awakening in the 1700s. Humble us and enable us to see Jesus Christ as the Lamb of God. Help this nation see their condemnation before You and cry out to Jesus for mercy and help. And awaken the Church across this land. Give us boldness to shout from the roof tops and in the alleys and slums, in the broken homes and the halls of government. Invade this nation once again by the Holy Spirit and power. Turn us, return us, to fear You and follow Jesus. Give us Jesus, Father we ask; give us Jesus lest we perish. Amen. (Romans 13:1-7; I Timothy 2:1-3)</div>
