<div class="m">
<div class="c-drop">8</div> Faithful Father, Faithful Savior, Faithful Spirit—Holy Trinity, Holy God, and God of heaven and earth. You have promised to remain faithful even when we are faithless. Forgive us when our affections towards You are weak; when our earnestness for Your kingdom wanes. You know that we are too often and too easily persuaded by our feelings and moods; and that too often our affections stray and grow lukewarm towards You. Too often we say and do things that we should not, and just as often we don’t speak, love, and pray as we ought. Indeed, we are too often unfaithful in living how we believe and how we want to believer. Forgive us, LORD.</div>
<div class="p">But Your love for us is a maturing love and not an abandoning love. We know that You are not finished working within us. Praise be to our God! As it is written, the good work that You began in us will be completed at the day of Jesus Christ.</div>
<div class="p">Knowing Your faithful love towards us we are drawn to be more faithful towards You. O’ Spirit, You draw us with a love that calls us to trust You, to obey You, and to want You more than life itself. Please continue to teach us the love of Christ that we may know Thee—the Triune Godhead, in Thy fulness. Amen. (Romans 3:3; 7:15-25; Philippians 1:6 Ephesians 3:19)</div>
